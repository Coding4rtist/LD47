## How to play
In looper you get stuck in a time loop. Every 10 seconds the timeloop reset the game and you'll face your past selves. Your mission is always to kill your target, which will allow you to go to the next loop.
The game starts easy, but quickly become challenging.

You get points by killing the target (+30) and your past selves (+10). My current best score is 350, can you do better?
